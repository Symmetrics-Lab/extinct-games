Extinct Games

# ExtinctGames

Do you know how many species are at risk of disappearing from earth? Do you know where is it happening?

With ExtinctGames you know will be aware of what is going on.

We decided to build this app to raise awareness about the biodiversity loss we face each day.

- You can see the growing list of species that are extremely endangered, endangered or vulnerable, and check facts about them.

- Do you think this is happening in only one place? with exploration mode discover where are the most endangered areas of the planet.

- Challenge your ecological conceptions with the trivia, and learn something new about this issue.

We added a few of the most endangered species on earth, and we intend to add more every day. If you want to help, please donate to the many NGOs that are helping the planet. We suggest helping the World Wildlife Fund
